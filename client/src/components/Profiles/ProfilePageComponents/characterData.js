We think we're pre-eminent. We think that puts us above other animals, and makes other animals okay to hunt. I love animals. But I hunt them all the same, because we're pre-eminent. And I love humans, too. Tell me. If prey gets caught, what does that mean? It means they were beneath their predator. What are they no longer? Pre-eminent.",

Only the self-moving, never leaving self, never ceases to move, and is the fountain and beginning of motion to all that moves besides. Now, the beginning is unbegotten, for that which is begotten has a beginning; but the beginning is begotten of nothing, for if it were begotten of something, then the begotten would not come from a beginning. But if unbegotten, it must also be indestructible; for if beginning were destroyed, there could be no beginning out of anything, nor anything out of a beginning; and all things must have a beginning.",
